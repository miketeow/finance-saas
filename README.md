# Full Stack Financial SaaS Application Tutorial

This project is a full stack financial SaaS application using modern web technologies including [Hono](https://honojs.dev/), [React-Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [Drizzle ORM](https://drizzle-orm.com/), [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Neon](https://neon.tech/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The tutorial follows the video [Build a Finance SaaS Platform With Nextjs, React, Honojs with CSV Upload (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_uNKAus0II) by [Code with Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio).

## Development Log

1. **Database Usage**: The Neon database used in this project may be reused for future projects.
2. **Framework Observations**: While evaluating Hono and React-Query against Server Action, the main advantages observed are TypeScript support and enhanced auto-completion when implementing APIs.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Bulk-Delete API Implementation**: When implementing an API for bulk deletion, use a POST request to pass an array of IDs in the request body.
